A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world.

Since October 2017, he has been the top-ranked ODI batsman in the world and is currently the leading batsman in the Test rankings.

Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup.
